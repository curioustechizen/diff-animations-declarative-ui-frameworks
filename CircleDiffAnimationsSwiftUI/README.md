### Checklist

- [x] Circular layout (Based on [CDCircularMenu](https://github.com/christophedellac/CDCircularMenu))
- [x] Basic animations of views that are common in before and after
- [x] Animating of newly appearing views 
- [x] Animating disappearing views  (this is very easy: just animating state changes using `withAnimation` on the button click was sufficient!)
